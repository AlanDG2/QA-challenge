# QA Challenge

## Objective
The purpose of this challenge is to test your QA skills in a practical scenario. At [https://qa-challenge.ensolvers.com](https://qa-challenge.ensolvers.com), you will find a very simple to-do app which allows you to manage to-do items and group them in folders. You can log in as a user with "user" both as a username and password.

In this challenge you will need to:

- **Task 1**: Build a Use Case list specifying, with the most formal description possible, the different flows to be tested so they can be used as a reference for testing the app by you or any other QA team member.
- **Task 2**: Test the app end-to-end and report any bug or UX issue that you consider needs to be solved. Again, in this case, you must be as formal as possible when describing each one using the tools, templates, and/or artifacts that you think suit better for this task.
- **Task 3**: Write a suite of automated tests using Selenium, Cypress, or any other tool/framework you know to automatically check if all the flows defined in Task 1 are fulfilled as expected.

## Deliverables
- For **Task 1**, a document describing each flow.
- For **Task 2**, if applicable, a description in detail of each bug or UX issue.
- For **Task 3**, a suite of automated tests that implements the automatic tests.
